            This is an S2 instance. S2 is like S3, except much less.
            It's buckets of files, over vanilla HTTP REST commands. S2 is for internal/private networks only, and is
            intended for individuals, small teams, devops systems etc that need easy REST without Boto, XML or any of the 
            over-complicated rituals S3 demands. S2 SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC INTERNET.
